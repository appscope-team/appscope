"    OVERVIEW:\n"
"    The Scope library supports extraction of data from within applications.\n"
"    As a general rule, applications consist of one or more processes.\n"
"    The Scope library can be loaded into any process as the\n"
"    process starts.\n"
"    The primary way to define which processes include the Scope library\n"
"    is by exporting the environment variable LD_PRELOAD, which is set to point\n"
"    to the path name of the Scope library. E.g.: \n"
"    export LD_PRELOAD=./libscope.so\n"
"\n"
"    Scope emits data as metrics and/or events.\n"
"    Scope is fully configurable by means of a configuration file (scope.yml)\n"
"    and/or environment variables.\n"
"\n"
"    Metrics are emitted in StatsD format, over a configurable link. By default,\n"
"    metrics are sent over a UDP socket using localhost and port 8125.\n"
"\n"
"    Events are emitted in JSON format over a configurable link. By default,\n"
"    events are sent over a TCP socket using localhost and port 9109.\n"
"\n"
"    Scope logs to a configurable destination, at a configurable\n"
"    verbosity level. The default verbosity setting is level 4, and the\n"
