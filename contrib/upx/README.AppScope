This folder contains a copy of UPX's `devel` branch from 2021-09-10. We found
the released version at that time (3.96) was causing issues on ARM. The
compressed version of our `scope` binary was crashing when running even simple
commands like `scope version`. The problem goes away when we use this version
instead.
