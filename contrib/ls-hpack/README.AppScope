# AppScope `ls-hpack` Contrib Package

This directory contains a copy of the `litespeedtech/ls-hpack` package. It was
added during work on \#543 to parse HTTP/2 HEADERS frames.

* Project: https://github.com/litespeedtech/ls-hpack
* Release: v2.3.0 2021-09-14

We downloaded `ls-hpack-2.3.0.tar.gz`, unpacked it here, and added this file.
We build it using [`contrib/Makefile`](../Makefile).
