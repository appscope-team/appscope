title: Troubleshooting and Crash Analysis
---

You can use AppScope to [troubleshoot an application](#crash-analysis) that's behaving problematically:

- Whenever a scoped app crashes, AppScope can obtain a core dump, a backtrace (i.e., stack trace), or both, while capturing supplemental information in text files.

- AppScope can generate a **snapshot** file containing debug information about processes that are running normally or crashing, unscoped or scoped.

On the other hand, you can [troubleshoot AppScope itself](#troubleshoot-appscope) if you're trying to scope an application but not getting the results you expect:

- AppScope can retrieve the config currently in effect; you can then update (modify) it dynamically as desired.

- AppScope can determine the status of the transport it's trying to use to convey events and metrics to a destination. This helps troubleshoot "Why am I getting no events or metrics?" scenarios.
