title: Using TLS for Secure Connections

## Using TLS for Secure Connections

AppScope supports TLS over TCP connections: 

- AppScope can use TLS when connecting to LogStream or another application (including its events and metrics destinations).
- LogStream can use TLS when connecting to AppScope over TCP.

To see the TLS-related environment variables, run the command: `ldscope --help configuration | grep TLS`

In the `scope.yml` config file, the `transport` definition includes an optional `tls` element. See [Config Files](/docs/config-files).

## Using TLS in Cribl.Cloud

In Cribl.Cloud, when communicating with LogStream, AppScope uses TLS by default.

Within Cribl.Cloud, a front-end load balancer (reverse proxy) handles the encrypted TLS traffic and relays it to the AppScope Source port in LogStream. The connection from the load balancer to LogStream does **not** use TLS, and you should not enable TLS on the [AppScope Source](https://docs.cribl.io/docs/sources-appscope) in LogStream. No changes in LogStream configuration are needed.

AppScope connects to port 10090 of the Cribl.Cloud Ingest Endpoint. Use the tenant hostname you were assigned when you joined Cribl.Cloud.

### CLI usage

Use scope with the `-c` option:

```
scope -c tls://host:10090
```

### Configuration for `LD_PRELOAD` or `ldscope`

To connect AppScope to a LogStream Cloud instance using TLS: 

1. Enable the `tls` element in `scope.yml`.
1. Connect to port 10090 on your Cribl.Cloud Ingest Endpoint.

To enable TLS in `scope.yml`, adapt the example below to your environment:

```
cribl:
  enable: true
  transport:
    type: tcp  # don't use tls here, use tcp and enable tls below
    host: in.logstream.example-tenant.cribl.cloud
    port: 10090 # cribl.cloud's port for the TLS AppScope Source
    tls:
      enable: true
      validateserver: true
      cacertpath: ''
```

## Scoping Without TLS

If you prefer to communicate without encryption, connect to port 10091 instead of port 10090.

If it is enabled, disable the `tls` element in `scope.yml`.

If connecting to LogStream in Cribl.Cloud, no changes in LogStream configuration are needed.
